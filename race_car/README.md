This example is based on the publication: *NMPC for Racing Using a Singularity-Free Path-Parametric Model with Obstacle Avoidance - Daniel Kloeser, Tobias Schoels, Tommaso Sartor, Andrea Zanelli, Gianluca Frison, Moritz Diehl. Proceedings of the 21th IFAC World Congress, Berlin, Germany - July 2020* ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896320317845)).

The goal is to drive around the track in minimum time, with a progress-maximizing OCP reformulation in the MPC. To reproduce the results in our paper, one should first run the `run_bo.py` script, followed by `test_bo.py`. The `run_bo_combined.py` and `test_bo_combined.py` scripts can be used to run BO using trials from both cars (small and large).
